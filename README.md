# Pick and place Robotic-arm intended for objects sorting task.

✔️Robot Features:

5R Robotics-Arm with inverse kinematics, a camera with computer vision to detect,
classify objects and with grid calibration to provide high accuracy coordinates 
as feedback to the manipulator system to execute the pick and place task.

✔️Processing & Communication:

RaspberryPi is the main processing unit, it sends the required data to Arduino via Bluetooth that controls the arm. 
and all of these will be done with Python and ArduinoC Programming languages

✔️Many exciting concepts were applied while making the project come to life:

-Applying the concept of MultiThreading in Python

-More experience in parallel and concurrent execution

-Applying PEP-8 standards and S.O.L.I.D principles.
